Static : Static keyword is primarily used for memory managment
✅ Use Cases of static in Java:
Usage	Description
static variable	Shared across all instances of the class. Memory is allocated only once.
static method	Can be called without creating an object. It can access only static members.
static block	Used for static initialization of a class. Runs once when the class is loaded.
static class	Inner class can be made static. Doesn’t need reference to the outer class.

# The main concept behind static is that it belong to the class rather than instance of  the class
#Non-static members are accessed through objects, while static members are accessed through the class name.
=> Always access static members using the class name to clearly indicate they are class-level.
Non-static methods belong to an instance (object) of the class

❌Static methods belong to the class itself, not to any specific object.
🔍 So What Happens?
If you try to call a non-static method inside a static method (like main()), Java will throw a compile-time error,

# THIS AND SUPER CANNOT BE USED IN STATIC CONTEXT
🔹 Why?
Because:

**this** refers to the current object of a class.

**super** refers to the parent class's instance (used to access parent methods/constructors).

But…

Static context means no object exists. So there's no this or super to refer to.

=>Static is initialized before any object is created.
✅ Why?
Because static members belong to the class itself, not to any object.

So when the class is loaded into memory (even before you create any object), all static variables and static blocks are initialized.

🔁 Execution Order in Java:
1. Static variables and static blocks (executed once when the class is loaded).

2. Then, main() method (also static) runs.
static block use for initillizing static variables;

3. Only after that, if you create an object:

Instance variables

Instance blocks

Constructor
