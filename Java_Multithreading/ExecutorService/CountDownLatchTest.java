//CountDownLatch is a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations in other threads completes.
//
//        ðŸ§  Key Concept
//It maintains a count, and threads wait on the latch until the count reaches zero.
//
//countDown() â€“ Decrements the count.
//
//await() â€“ Makes a thread wait until the count is zero.
//
//âœ… Common Use Cases
//Waiting for multiple threads to finish before proceeding.
//
//Waiting for some resources to be initialized before starting work.
//
//Simulating a start signal for multiple threads (like a race).
