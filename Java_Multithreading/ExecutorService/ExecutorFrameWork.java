//ðŸ”„ Thread Pooling in Java
//  Thread Pooling is a technique to manage and reuse a limited number of threads to execute multiple tasks efficiently. Instead of creating a new thread for every task, a pool of threads is maintained and r0eused,
//  which reduces overhead and improves performance, especially in applications that handle a large number of short tasks.
//! The Executors framework was introduced in Java 5 as part of the java.util.concurrent package to simplify the development
//!of concurrent applications by abstracting away many of the complexities involved in creating and managing threads.


//!It will help in
//
//?Avoiding Manual Thread management
//?Resource management
//?Scalability
//?Thread reuse
//?Error handling
