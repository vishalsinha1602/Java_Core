package Java_Multithreading;

//! A ThreadPool in Java is a pool of worker threads that are reused to execute tasks.
//! Instead of creating a new thread for every task (which is expensive),
//! a thread pool maintains a pool of threads and reuses them, improving performance—especially in a multithreaded environment.
//
//✅ Why use a ThreadPool?
//Improves performance by reusing threads.
//
//Limits resource usage (you control the number of threads).
//
//Manages concurrency better.
//
//Avoids overhead of frequent thread creation/destruction.
