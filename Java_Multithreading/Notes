What is a Thread in Java?
In Java, a thread is the smallest unit of execution within a program. It represents an independent path of execution that runs concurrently with other threads inside the same program.

💻 Process
A process is an independent program that is running on your computer.
Each process has:
Its own memory
Its own resources (like files, variables)
Its own execution path

👉 Think of a process like a separate app — for example, when you open Chrome and MS Word, each one runs in its own process.

🧵 Thread
A thread is a smaller task inside a process.
All threads in a process:
Share the same memory
Can run at the same time
Are lightweight and faster to create

🧵 Single-threaded Program
Executes one task at a time.
Only one thread (main thread) runs from start to finish.
All operations happen one after the other — no parallel execution.
🧠 Example:
A program that reads a file, then prints its content, and only after that allows user input.
🧊 Limitation:
If one task takes time (like downloading a file), the entire program waits.

🔀 Multi-threaded Program
Executes multiple tasks at the same time using multiple threads.
Threads share the same memory and run concurrently.
Makes programs faster, more responsive, especially for tasks like animation, file I/O, networking.
🧠 Example:
A game where one thread handles player movement, another handles music, and another handles enemy AI — all running at the same time.
🚀 Advantage:
Improves performance and responsiveness of programs.

✅ Benefits of Multithreading
Benefit	Description
⚡ Improved Performance	Tasks run in parallel, reducing overall execution time.
🧠 Better Resource Utilization	Makes better use of CPU cores (especially multi-core systems).
🖱️ Improved Responsiveness	UI stays responsive while background tasks (e.g., downloading, processing) continue.
🔄 Efficient Waiting	While one thread waits (e.g., for I/O), others can do useful work.
🔁 Simplifies Modeling Concurrent Tasks	Helps simulate real-world scenarios like multiple users or tasks happening simultaneously.

❌ Drawbacks of Multithreading
Drawback	Description
⚠️ Complex to Design and Debug	Synchronizing threads to avoid conflicts (race conditions, deadlocks) is tricky.
🔄 Overhead of Context Switching	Frequent switching between threads can reduce performance if too many threads run.
🧩 Shared Resource Issues	Threads share memory — if not handled properly, it can lead to data inconsistency.
🔒 Deadlocks and Race Conditions	Poor synchronization can cause threads to wait forever (deadlock) or corrupt data (race condition).
📊 Not Always Faster	For small tasks or on single-core CPUs, it may not improve speed and can even slow things dow
